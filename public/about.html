<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have many varied interests including medicine (pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine, website creation both with my own database as well as with WordPress utilizing Elementor for help with making the site dynamic, and a husband and father.</p>

<p>Trying to find time for all these pursuits takes dedication, persistence, and discipline.  I had to develop these characteristics when I was in medical school, trying to learn all the vagarites of medicine.</p>

<p>I am hopeful you will find this site interesting as it is the beginning of something much greater!</p>
